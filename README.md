# Momenta Audio Deepfake Detection  

## Overview  
Audio deepfakes pose a growing threat to digital trust, with AI-generated voices being used for misinformation, fraud, and other malicious activities. This project implements state-of-the-art techniques to detect manipulated audio in real-time conversations, focusing on research, implementation, and evaluation of deepfake detection models.  

---

## 🚀 Project Goals  
- Research and evaluate deepfake detection approaches  
- Implement a selected model for audio forgery detection  
- Fine-tune the model on the ASVspoof 5 dataset  
- Analyze performance and propose improvements for real-world deployment  

---

## 🏗️ Approach  
**1. Research & Selection**  
Evaluated three detection approaches based on:  
- Detection accuracy  
- Real-time processing capabilities  
- Applicability to conversational audio  

**2. Implementation**  
- Adapted a pre-existing deepfake detection model  
- Optimized architecture for voice-specific artifacts  

**3. Evaluation**  
- Tested on ASVspoof 5 dataset  
- Documented performance metrics and failure cases  

**4. Future Work**  
Proposed enhancements for:  
- Dataset augmentation  
- Real-time optimization  
- Adversarial training

## 🛠️ Installation  
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yashraj-shri17/Momenta-Audio-Deepfake-Detection.git
cd Momenta-Audio-Deepfake-Detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r implementation/requirements.txt
```

**Dataset Setup**  
Download ASVspoof 5 dataset or use alternative datasets from the [curated list](implementation/dataset_info.md).

---

## 📝 Usage  
**Workflow**  
1. **Preprocessing**  
```python
# Sample preprocessing code
from audio_processor import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("path/to/audio_files")
```

2. **Training**  
Execute cells in `implementation/implementation.ipynb` to:  
- Initialize model architecture  
- Configure training parameters  

3. **Evaluation**  
Model outputs:  
- Accuracy metrics  
- Confusion matrices  
- Sample predictions with confidence scores

## 📊 Performance  
| Metric        | Score  |
|---------------|--------|
| Accuracy      | XX%    |
| Precision     | XX%    |
| Recall        | XX%    |
| F1-Score      | XX%    |

**Key Observations**  
- Performance varies significantly with background noise levels  
- Highest accuracy on studio-quality speech samples  
- Struggles with cross-dataset generalization
