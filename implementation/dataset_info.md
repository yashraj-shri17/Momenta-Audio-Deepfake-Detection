# ASVspoof 2021 (ASVspoof 5) Dataset

## Overview
The **ASVspoof 2021 dataset**, also known as **ASVspoof 5**, is a benchmark dataset for research in **automatic speaker verification (ASV) and spoofing countermeasures**. It is used to develop and evaluate systems that distinguish between genuine and spoofed (deepfake) audio samples.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of 3 major tracks:
1. **LA (Logical Access)** - Contains audio samples generated using text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) attacks.
2. **PA (Physical Access)** - Includes replay attacks where genuine audio is captured and played back.
3. **DF (Deepfake)** - Focuses on detecting synthetic speech generated by advanced deep learning techniques.

Each track contains labeled audio files in **FLAC** format, along with metadata specifying speaker IDs, attack types, and labels (genuine or spoofed).

## Features
- **Audio Format**: FLAC, WAV (16 kHz sampling rate, 16-bit PCM)
- **Labels**:
  - `bonafide` (genuine)
  - `spoof` (fake, generated by AI or replay attack)
- **Speaker Variability**: Includes diverse voices to ensure robustness.
- **Attacks Covered**: Speech synthesis (TTS), voice conversion (VC), adversarial attacks, replay attacks.

## Usage
- **Training Deep Learning Models**: Develop CNN, RNN, and hybrid models (CNN-GRU) for deepfake detection.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare spoof detection models against a standardized dataset.
- **Generalization Studies**: Analyze how well models perform across different types of attacks.
