## 🗂️ **1. Dataset Challenges**

### 🔹 **Limited Availability of High-Quality Datasets**
The **ASVspoof dataset** was useful, but obtaining diverse data covering different deepfake attack methods was difficult.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Applied **data augmentation** techniques (noise addition, pitch shifting, time stretching) to enhance model generalization.

### 🔹 **File Format Compatibility Issues**
Many audio files were in **MP3 format**, but the model required **FLAC**.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Implemented an **automated conversion pipeline** using `pydub` to convert MP3 to FLAC.

## 🧠 **2. Model Training Challenges**

### 🔹 **Computational Constraints**
**CNN-GRU models** require significant computing power, making training difficult on standard hardware.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Used **GPU acceleration** with PyTorch and optimized batch sizes.  
- Experimented with **mixed-precision training** for efficiency.

### 🔹 **Overfitting on Training Data**
The model performed well on training data but struggled with **unseen test data**.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Introduced **dropout layers** and **weight regularization**.  
- Increased dataset **diversity** to enhance generalization.

## 📊 **3. Performance Evaluation Challenges**

### 🔹 **Handling Class Imbalance**
More **bonafide** samples than **spoofed** ones led to biased predictions.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Used **weighted loss functions** and **balanced mini-batches** during training.

### 🔹 **Equal Error Rate (EER) Calculation**
EER computation required **threshold tuning** and **ROC curve analysis**.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Implemented a **custom script** to calculate EER using **FAR (False Acceptance Rate)** and **FRR (False Rejection Rate)**.

## 🚀 **4. Deployment & Real-Time Inference Challenges**

### 🔹 **Latency Issues in Real-Time Detection**
Processing raw audio files introduced **latency**.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Used **feature extraction techniques** (MFCCs, spectrograms) to **speed up inference** while maintaining accuracy.

### 🔹 **Scalability Concerns**
Running the model on a **live streaming system** required **low-latency optimizations**.  
✅ **Solution:**  
- Explored **model quantization** and **pruning** to reduce computational costs.
